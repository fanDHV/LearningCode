1. 25/01/2014:
  - already computed angles of faces in "Poly.cpp".
  - but not yet used sucessfully because of parameter passing problem.
  - then now compute directly in "slice-mngt.cpp" in the constructor.
  
  --> it however woulb be nice if we include the angle calculation in "Poly.cpp".
  
2. 29/01/2014:
  - recall check the status of shooting points (interior, vertex of terrain, or
    on lateral edge).
  - then recall the refinement of the shooting points in each status of the 
    points.
  - finally check if the calculating the curve angle which follows the straightest
    geodesics, is correct or not.
  
  - angle calculation is duplicated in both "checkCollinear" and "computeUpdate"
  
3. 30/01/2014:
  - Face::isOn: not on face at all!
  - need to recall the checking if a next shooting point goes outside of current
    segment on slice.
